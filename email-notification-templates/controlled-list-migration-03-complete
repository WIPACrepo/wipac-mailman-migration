Subject: Mailing list cutover is complete

If you are reading this, the mailing list has been transitioned to the new system and you are able to receive messages sent to the list.

The migration of the archive of this list's messages to https://groups.google.com will begin soon and may take several hours to complete. 

If you wish to receive list traffic in digest form, go to https://groups.google.com, login with your IceCube account, and, in the "My Groups" view, change "Each mail" to "Digest" in the "Subscription" column. If you are subscribed using a non-IceCube address, email help@icecube.wisc.edu to get your delivery mode changed.

Please let me know if you notice anything strange or have questions or concerns.
