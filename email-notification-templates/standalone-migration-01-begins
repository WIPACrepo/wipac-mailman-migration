Subject: Important: list migration to Google Groups about to begin

Hello

This mailing list, __LIST_NAME__, is about to be migrated from Mailman to Google Groups, which will result in the following changes:

* Archives will move to https://groups.google.com.
* Membership settings will be managed from https://groups.google.com.
* Access to https://groups.google.com will be restricted to accounts of organizations federated with Google (these include @icecube.wisc.edu, @wisc.edu, @gmail.com).
* Posting from accounts matching regular expressions in [1], which Mailman allowed, will no longer work.
    XXX ONLY IF THIS IS APPLICABLE TO THIS MAILING LIST XXX

I will send an email to this list once the transition is complete. If you don't receive it within a couple of hours please contact me.
