Subject: Important information about this mailing list

On __DATE__, this mailing list, __LIST_EMAIL_ (aka [__LIST_NAME__]) will be transitioned to our new system for mailing list management and become subject to new restrictions. The transition should involve no downtime.

TLDR:
(1) Members who are subscribed using @icecube.wisc.edu address don't need to do anything.
(2) Members who use non-IceCube email addresses will need to take action (in most cases it will only take a minute).
(3) Archives will be available on https://groups.google.com.
(4) (Un)subscriptions will be handled via https://user-management.icecube.aq.
(5) Subscribers who are not members of an institution belonging to __EXPERIMENTS__ experiment(s) will be automatically removed from __LIST_NAME__ (you can check on https://user-management.icecube.aq).

The biggest user-facing change will be that only IceCube email addresses, and non-IceCube addresses specified in "mailing_list_email" user attribute will be allowed to be members of __LIST_NAME__. List members who use IceCube email addresses will not need to take any action to continue to use this mailing list. List members who use non-IceCube email addresses will receive instructions on how to keep their subscription. Note that it will not be possible for a single individual to be subscribed to the list using multiple email addresses. 

Another new restriction will be that all __LIST_NAME__ members must also be members of an institution that belongs to the __EXPERIMENTS__ experiment(s). Users who don't meet this requirement will be automatically removed from this mailing list after a grace period. You can view and join experiments/institutions from https://user-management.icecube.aq. We will notify existing members who may not belong to the required experiments.

After the transition, __LIST_NAME__ message archives, including past messages, will be available on https://groups.google.com (you will need to sign in [1] using your IceCube account, even if you are subscribed using a non-IceCube email address).

Subscriptions and unsubscriptions will be handled using https://user-management.icecube.aq group membership request/approve/leave workflow [2]. This mailing list corresponds to group "__FULL_LIST_GROUP_PATH__".

Members who receive list traffic in digest form will need to go to https://groups.google.com, login with their IceCube account, and, in the "My Groups" view, change "Each mail" to "Digest" in the "Subscription" column.

Everybody who will transition to the new system will receive an email notifying them of being subscribed to this mailing list before we actually cutover. It's the new system acknowledging addition of new users.

If you receive neither subscription confirmation nor instructions on how to subscribe to the mailing list, please contact me.
