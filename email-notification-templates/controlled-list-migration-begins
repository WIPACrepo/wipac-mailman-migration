Subject: Mailing list cutover begins now

I am about to begin the cutover process that will transition this list to our new mailing list management system. I expect no disruption for folks who have followed the instructions sent out earlier.

Some of you will receive duplicate emails with transition instructions. Unfortunately there is no way to avoid this duplication. If you have already completed the required steps, please ignore the duplicates. If you haven't, you will stop receiving this list's messages until you take actions described in the instructions.

I will send an "all-clear" email once the cutover is complete. Please let me know if you don't receive it after a few hours or if you have questions/concerns.
