Subject: Important information about this mailing list

On __DATE__, this mailing list, __LIST_EMAIL__ (aka [__LIST_NAME__]) will be transitioned to our new system for mailing list management and will become subject to new restrictions.

Summary:
(1) Members who are subscribed with IceCube addresses likely won't need to take any action.
(2) Members who use non-IceCube email addresses may need to take action.
(3) Archives will be available on https://groups.google.com.
(4) (Un)subscriptions will be handled via https://user-management.icecube.aq.
(5) Membership will be restricted to current members of institutions belonging to the following experiment(s): __EXPERIMENTS__.

The details:

The biggest user-facing change will be that only IceCube email addresses, and non-IceCube addresses specified in the "List Email" user profile attribute will be allowed to be members of [__LIST_NAME__]. If you are subscribed using a different email address, you will receive a separate email with instructions.

Another new restriction will be that all [__LIST_NAME__] subscribers must be current members of an institution that belongs to __EXPERIMENTS__ experiment(s). Subscribers who don't meet this requirement will be automatically removed from this mailing list after a grace period. We will send separate instructions to the affected folks.

After the transition, [__LIST_NAME__] message archives, including past messages, will be available on https://groups.google.com (you will need to sign in using your IceCube account [1], even if you are subscribed using a non-IceCube email address).

Subscriptions and un-subscriptions will be handled using https://user-management.icecube.aq group membership request/approve/leave workflow [2]. Note that this mailing list corresponds to the group __FULL_LIST_GROUP_PATH__.

You should receive a notification about being subscribed to this mailing list before we actually cutover to the new system. If you receive neither a subscription confirmation nor instructions on how to re-subscribe to the mailing list, please contact help@icecube.wisc.edu.
